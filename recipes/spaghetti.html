    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound dried spaghetti noodles (450g)</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground meat like ground beef, ground turkey, or bulk Italian sausage (450g)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onion (130g)</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, minced, 1 tablespoon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water, broth, or dry red wine (236ml)</li>
        <li>1 (28oz) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Handful of fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. Use a wooden spoon to break the meat into smaller crumbles as the meat cooks.</li>
        <li> Add the onions and cook, stirring every once in a while, until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, ¾ teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook uncovered for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for seasoning suggestions).</li>
        <li>About 15 minutes before the spaghetti sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, cook the pasta according to the package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time. Drain.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from the heat and stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta and leave for a minute so that it absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with grated parmesan cheese on top.</li>
    </ol>
