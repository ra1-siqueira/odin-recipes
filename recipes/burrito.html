    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups refried beans</li>
        <li>¾ cup corn kernels</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked rice</li>
        <li>6 large (10-inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded cheddar cheese or Mexican cheese blend</li>
        <li>Optional garnish: finely diced red onion; lettuce; diced tomato or salsa; sour cream; fresh cilantro; avocado or guacamole</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray; set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the beef with the taco seasoning mix, according to the seasoning package instructions.
        </li>
        <li>To prepare 1 burrito: spread ¼ cup beans down center of tortillas; top with ½ cup rice, beef, 2 tablespoons corn, and ¼ cup cheese.</li>
        <li>Fold in opposite sides of each tortilla, then roll up, burrito style. Place, seam-sides down, in prepared dish. Repeat with remaining ingredients to prepare 6 total burritos.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes (until heated through). If you are baking the burritos from the refrigerator while they're still cold, it will take about 30-35 minutes for them to heat through.</li>
    </ol>
